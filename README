# Project 6 - TranslateMe

Submitted by: Nakisha Strickland

TranslateMe is an app that lets users quickly translate English phrases into Spanish, French, or Korean. It also stores a translation history and allows users to erase translations at any time.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [x] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [x] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [x] The history of translations can be erased
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [x] Add UI flair

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Firebase authentication (Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out)
- [x] Clean and easy-to-read layout

-Handling duplicated view files and Xcode conflicts
-Ensuring the sign-in state correctly updated between LoginView and HomeView
-Fixing picker and async translation responsiveness
